    <h1>A Paragraph about me</h1>
    <p>I'm Gyumin Kim. You can just call me Chris Kim for easier pronunciation. 
        You may have noticed from my last name, I'm from South Korea. 
        I studied environmental science at SFU last year and transferred to BCIT to study computing technology. 
        My goal is to become a professional web developer!  
        I also love playing games and sports!</p>
